# TheFootballFanApp
A passion project dedicated towards the average Bulgarian Football Fan, providing all neccesarry information for his favorite team. The website includes information about matches, travel tips and much more.

## Virtual Environment Setup
The following project was set up on a conda venv, due to some unexpected issues with pip, but the latter could also be used.

### Installing conda
Here is a brief installation guide:
1) Download the anaconda version according to your Operating System (https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
2) Run through the anaconda installer
3) Open the terminal and type in the following command to create a new virtual environment

You may need to pass in at least 1 starting package in your newly created venv.

4) Afterwards you need to activate your new env with the following command

You can watch the following video as a reference guide(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJC6ldI3hWk&t=406s&ab_channel=CoreySchafer). 

## Installing packages
A list with the required libraries for installation can be found in the Requirements.txt file. 
This list is expected to grow with upcoming updates.
Here, an example installation with one of the packages is shown:

To install any package in an already existing conda venv, simply replace the last word (in this case 'selenium') with the package that you need to install.

To check if a package already exists in your virtual environment, type the following command:
